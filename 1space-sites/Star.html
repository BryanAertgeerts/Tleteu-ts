      <p>
        At the heart of the solar system lies a star known as Ēnlū, which serves
        as the primary and most vital source of energy for life on the planet
        Tleteuāts. Its gravitational pull governs the movements of the
        surrounding planets, and its light and heat are fundamental to
        sustaining life within the system. Without the warmth and energy
        provided by Ēnlū, the ecosystem of Tleteuāts would be unable to thrive.
        As the central figure in the system, Ēnlū is not only important for its
        energy output but also as a key player in the formation and evolution of
        planetary bodies around it.

      <h2 class="section-title">Etymology (WIP)</h2>
      <p>
        The name "Ēnlū" is derived from ancient language roots that signify
        "life-bringer," reflecting the star's crucial role in sustaining life on
        Tleteuāts. Over time, this name has become synonymous with vitality and
        warmth in the local culture, further reinforcing its significance as the
        cornerstone of existence in the system.
      </p>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
      <h2 class="section-title">General Characteristics</h2>
      <p>
        Ēnlū is classified as a K-type main-sequence star with a spectral type
        of K7.6V, placing it in the category of stars that are somewhat cooler
        than our Sun. It accounts for more than 99% of the total mass within the
        solar system, making it by far the most massive object in its system.
        The star’s composition consists primarily of hydrogen and helium, the
        two most abundant elements in the universe, with a range of trace
        elements contributing to its unique chemical makeup. With an absolute
        magnitude of +7.37, Ēnlū is moderately luminous, and though not as
        bright as some of the more massive stars in the galaxy, its luminosity
        is consistent with its position on the main sequence.
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>
        Its surface temperature is approximately 4057 K, which classifies it as
        a cooler star when compared to the Sun. The radius of Ēnlū is about
        0.624 times the radius of the Sun (Rsol), which is relatively smaller in
        comparison. However, despite its smaller size and lower temperature,
        Ēnlū is highly stable and is expected to have a long-lasting presence in
        its current state. It has a projected lifespan of approximately 58.495
        billion years, during which time it will continue the process of nuclear
        fusion, converting hydrogen into helium in its core.

      <h2 class="section-title">Formation and Lifespan</h2>
      <p>
        Ēnlū, like many stars, originated from a dense molecular cloud about
        3.962 billion years ago. The star formed as the gas and dust in the
        cloud collapsed under gravity, eventually igniting nuclear fusion in its
        core. Ēnlū's mass is about 0.555 times that of the Sun, and its radius
        is 0.624 times the radius of the Sun. While it is smaller and less
        luminous than the Sun, its longevity is its defining characteristic.
        Given its relatively low mass, Ēnlū will burn through its hydrogen fuel
        at a slower rate, resulting in a much longer life compared to more
        massive stars.
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>
        Currently, at an age of approximately 3.962 billion years, Ēnlū is in
        the prime of its life. Over the next several billion years, it will
        continue to provide a stable environment for any planets that orbit it.
        Situated within a habitable zone that ranges from about 0.294 to 0.423
        astronomical units (AU), Ēnlū is in an ideal location to support the
        potential for liquid water on planets within this zone.
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>
        In the far future, however, as Ēnlū exhausts its hydrogen fuel, it will
        undergo a dramatic transformation. It will likely expand into a red
        giant, shedding its outer layers and eventually leaving behind a dense
        white dwarf remnant. This process will unfold over billions of years, so
        while Ēnlū will eventually change, it will remain a dominant force in
        its system for a vast stretch of time, continuing its important role in
        the solar system long into the future.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Composition</h2>
      <p>
        The star Ēnlū is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, which
        together make up the vast majority of its mass. Hydrogen, as the most
        abundant element, serves as the primary fuel for the star’s nuclear
        fusion reactions, converting into helium in the core over billions of
        years. In addition to hydrogen and helium, a variety of trace elements
        are present, though in much smaller quantities. These elements, such as
        carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and iron, play key roles in the star’s
        chemical processes and contribute to its spectral characteristics. While
        Ēnlū is less metal-rich than more massive stars, these trace elements
        are still crucial for understanding its structure, stability, and energy
        production.
