      <p>
        The Ēnlū System hosts a diverse array of planets, each with unique
        characteristics shaped by their proximity to the star Ēnlū and their
        individual compositions. The inner region of the system, closest to
        Ēnlū, contains rocky terrestrial planets like Kle and Tleteuāts, with
        Tleteuāts being the only planet known to support life. These inner
        planets feature solid surfaces and, in some cases, atmospheres that
        interact dynamically with their environments.
      </p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>
        Beyond the system's frost line, in the outer region, lie the gas giants
        Ūtsatsa, Chinālo, and Shunāta. These massive planets are composed
        primarily of hydrogen and helium, with thick atmospheres that harbor
        turbulent weather patterns and powerful storms. Each gas giant is
        orbited by multiple moons, some of which present intriguing landscapes
        and potential for future exploration.

        <h2 class="section-title">Inner Planets: Kle</h2>
        <p>
          Kle, nestled closest to its parent star, emerges as a rugged stone
          planet, enduring the scorching intensity of its proximity to the
          stellar furnace. Devoid of any substantial atmosphere, Kle's surface
          is exposed to the unrelenting barrage of solar radiation, resulting in
          extreme temperatures that fluctuate drastically depending on the
          planet's position relative to its star. With no protective atmosphere
          to moderate its climate, Kle experiences a temperature range that is
          exceptionally variable, with temperatures soaring to blistering highs
          during the day and plummeting to chilling lows at night. The planet's
          axial tilt of 25.0 degrees further exacerbates these temperature
          extremes, leading to a harsh and unforgiving environment across its
          barren surface.
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          Despite its inhospitable conditions, Kle remains a prominent feature
          in the night sky when viewed from the nearby celestial body Tleteuāts.
          With an apparent magnitude of -2.72, Kle shines brightly against the
          backdrop of space, serving as a stark reminder of the diverse and
          often hostile nature of the cosmos. However, due to its proximity to
          the star, Kle is too close to observe directly, its surface obscured
          by the intense glare of its parent star.
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          As one of the closest planets to its star, Kle offers a glimpse into
          the extreme conditions that can exist in the vicinity of stellar
          bodies, serving as a testament to the resilience of celestial bodies
          in the face of adversity.

        </aside>
        <h2 class="section-title">Physical Characteristics:</h2>
        <p>
          Tleteuāts is best categorised as a “Earth-like”, due to its comparable
          but smaller mass, radius, density, and surface gravity. Its structure
          consists of an outermost silicate crust, a molten silicate mantle, a
          liquid iron outer core (whose flow generates the planet’s magnetic
          field) and a solid iron inner core. The planet’s surface is comprised
          of landmasses and liquid water oceans. The landmasses account for
          24.98% of the total surface area and are broken up into two main
          continents. In order of decreasing area, they are: WEST CONTINENT AND
          EAST CONTINENT. The current layout of the continents, in conjunction
          with the planet’s axial tilt (see next section), gives rise to a
          moderate global climate with a diverse array of climate zones across
          the planet. Our simulations indicate that the landmasses last formed a
          supercontinent about 450 million years ago, and the models predict the
          next supercontinent on Tleteuāts will occur within the next few 100
          million years.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-title">*** topografie*** (WIP) :</h2>
        <p>(WIP)</p>
        <h2 class="section-title">Orbital Characteristics:</h2>
        <p>
          A day on the Tleteuāts is about 22.8 Earth hours long, with the star
          rising in the east and setting in the west. Temperate and polar
          regions on Tleteuāts experience moderate seasonal variations in
          heating attributed to the planet’s rotational axis being tilted
          approximately 7° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. In the
          tropics (approximately 14° south to 14° north), the sun is directly
          overhead for at least one day per year, whereas in the polar regions
          (approximately 83° to 90° north and south), the sun never rises or
          sets for at least one day per year. Tleteuāts orbits its star at an
          average distance of 1.54 AU. Though this distance varies throughout
          the year, the planet remains at all times within the system’s
          habitable zone—a region of space stretching from 1.42 to 2.05 AU where
          temperatures are such that liquid water can exist on its surface.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-title">Atmosphere:</h2>
        <p>
          Tleteuāts atmosphere consists of mostly nitrogen and oxygen, though
          notably, its carbon dioxide content is rather high. It is suspected
          that this is a result of the increased volcanism occurring as a result
          of WEST CONTINENT beginning to rift apart. The high levels of CO2 have
          raised the planet’s temperature such that it is within human
          tolerances. Atmospheric surface pressure and density are also rather
          low, which impacts the local flora and fauna. Tleteuāts atmosphere is
          divided into three circulation cells per hemisphere: a Hadley cell
          extends from the equator to 30° north and south, a Ferrel cell extends
          from 30° to 60° north and south, and a final polar cell extends from
          60° north and south to the poles of the planet. At noon, when the star
          is at its zenith, the sky is a gray - bluish colour. Near sunrise and
          sunset, the sky turns a deep, dark grayish colour fading to warmer
          yellow and orange hues near the horizon.

        <h2 class="section-title">Tleteuāts - Getsi System:</h2>
        <p>
          Tleteuāts is encircled by a lone natural satellite known as Getsi.
          This moon exerts gravitational forces that result in tidal variations
          on Tleteuāts, with spring high tides reaching approximately 8 meters
          and spring low tides dropping to around -8 meters. During neap tides,
          the high tide elevates by about 1 meter, while the low tide decreases
          to approximately -1 meter. Because of Getsi's angular size, it
          occasions both total and annular eclipses on Tleteuāts.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-title">Plant life on Tleteuāts:</h2>
        <p>
          Plant life on Tleteuāts showcases extraordinary adaptations enabling
          efficient utilization of the star's light for photosynthesis. The
          majority of flora thriving on Tleteuāts have evolved to harness the
          optimal wavelengths emitted by the star, ensuring their sustainability
          and proliferation. This astute adaptation manifests in foliage
          displaying a rich spectrum of colors, ranging from a deep, luscious
          wine red to a velvety, enigmatic dark purple.

        <h2 class="section-title">Formation:</h2>
        <p>
          It is thought that Getsi formed long ago as a result of a collision
          between Tleteuāts and another proto-planetary object.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-title">Physical Characteristics:</h2>
        <p>
          Getsi is a substantial major satellite. Its mass, radius, density, and
          gravity are higher than those of any other moon in the Ēnlū system. It
          has a magnetic field and an atmosphere, though both are extremely
          tenuous. The Moon’s surface is marked by a moderate amount of impact
          craters, dormant shield volcanoes, and volcanic domes. It plays an
          important role in regulating Tleteuāts climate by stabilising its
          axial tilt.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-title">Orbital and Rotational Characteristics:</h2>
        <p>
          Getsi orbits Tleteuāts at a mean distance of 176300 km, taking 16.76
          local days to complete a full cycle (new moon to new moon), also known
          as a moon month. Getsi is tidally locked to Tleteuāts, therefore its
          rotational period about its axis is equivalent to its orbital period,
          both of which are 16.76 local days in duration. Getsi raises moderate,
          though appreciable, tides on Tleteuāts. When viewed from the surface
          of Tleteuāts, the apparent size of the moon is about the exact same
          size than the apparent size of the parent star, Ēnlū and 89% times
          bigger then earth’s moon. This allows Tleteuāts to experience both
          total and annular solar eclipses. At full moon, Getsi is 3.28 times as
          bright as earth’s moon.

        <p>
          Klenūtsē, situated at a moderate distance from its parent star, stands
          out as a world of stark contrasts and geological wonders. Its rugged
          surface, shaped by geological processes over millennia, is marked by
          towering mountains, deep valleys, and vast plains. Despite its barren
