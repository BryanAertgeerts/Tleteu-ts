      <p>
        The atmosphere of the planet has undergone profound changes over
        billions of years, evolving through distinct stages shaped by complex
        interactions of volcanic activity, biological processes, and geological
        transformations. Each stage reflects shifts in composition, pressure,
        and temperature, ultimately creating an environment capable of
        sustaining life.

            <h3>Stage 1: Initial Atmosphere</h3>
            <p>
              In the earliest days of the planet’s formation, the atmosphere was
              dominated by hydrogen (H₂) and helium (He), gases collected from
              the cosmic cloud from which the planet was born. However, with
              extremely high temperatures exceeding 100°C, these light gases
              quickly escaped into space. The planet’s lower gravity, compared
              to Earth, further limited its ability to retain these gases. The
              resulting atmosphere was thin, with pressures under 0.1 bars.

            <h3>Stage 2: Development of the Secondary Atmosphere</h3>
            <p>
              Over the next 10 to 100 million years, volcanic activity reshaped
              the atmosphere. Intense outgassing released heavier gases such as
              carbon dioxide (CO₂), water vapor (H₂O), and nitrogen (N₂),
              forming a new type of atmosphere. Trace amounts of methane (CH₄)
              and ammonia (NH₃) also emerged from the volcanic emissions. As the
              greenhouse effect took hold, aided by the planet’s close proximity
              to the Sun, temperatures remained high, stabilizing between 70°C
              and 100°C. The atmospheric pressure gradually increased to around
              0.3–0.5 bars.

            <h3>Stage 3: The Cooling Phase and Formation of Oceans</h3>
            <p>
              After roughly 100 million years, the planet began to cool, and
              water vapor condensed, leading to frequent rainfall and the
              formation of shallow oceans. As CO₂ dissolved into the oceans, it
              formed carbonates, reducing the amount of CO₂ in the atmosphere
              and stabilizing nitrogen levels. This shift moderated temperatures
              further, cooling the atmosphere to between 50°C and 70°C and
              establishing a more stable pressure around 0.6 bars. Nitrogen
              became the dominant gas, while traces of methane and ammonia
              persisted.

            <h3>Stage 4: The Rise of Oxygen</h3>
            <p>
              Between 0.5 to 1 billion years into the planet’s history, the
              emergence of photosynthetic organisms transformed the atmosphere
              yet again. These life forms gradually produced oxygen (O₂), which
              accumulated in the atmosphere, while CO₂ levels declined as it was
              converted by biological processes. This increase in oxygen,
              combined with decreasing greenhouse gases, led to a cooler and
              more stable climate, with temperatures ranging from 30°C to 50°C.

            <h3>Stage 5: A Stabilized Atmosphere</h3>
            <p>
              Over the next 2 to 4 billion years, the atmosphere continued to
              stabilize. Nitrogen (N₂) became the primary gas, with moderate
              amounts of oxygen (O₂) and only trace amounts of CO₂, creating a
              balance that could support complex ecosystems. With stable
              pressure around 0.8 bars and temperatures that ranged from -10°C
              to 30°C, this mature atmosphere provided the conditions necessary
              for a diverse array of life forms to thrive.

      <h2 class="section-title">Atmospheric Composition Over Time</h2>
      <p>
        This chart details the changes in major atmospheric gases over billions
        of years. Initially dominated by hydrogen (H₂) and helium (He), the
        atmosphere evolves as volcanic gases like CO₂, methane (CH₄), and
        ammonia (NH₃) increase. Over time, nitrogen (N₂) becomes the primary
        gas, while oxygen (O₂) levels rise gradually, potentially due to
        biological activity. By the current era, N₂ and O₂ dominate, with CO₂
        and trace gases at minimal levels.

      <h2 class="section-title">Atmospheric Pressure Over Time</h2>
      <p>
        This graph illustrates the increase in atmospheric pressure as the
        planet transitions from a thin, primary atmosphere composed of light
        gases to a denser, more stable atmosphere. Early volcanic activity
        contributes to a rapid increase in pressure, reaching around 0.8 bars in
        the current period. This stabilized pressure supports a climate suitable
        for complex life.

      <p>
        This graph shows the cooling trend of the planet as greenhouse gases
        decrease and water begins to condense, forming oceans. Early
        temperatures were high due to CO₂-rich volcanic outgassing and solar
        radiation, but as CO₂ levels drop, the climate becomes more stable.
        Temperatures now range between -10°C and 30°C, making the planet’s
        surface habitable for diverse ecosystems.

      <h2 class="section-title">Sky Color</h2>
      <p>
        the sky exhibits distinct colors throughout the day. At noon, when the
        star is at its zenith, the sky displays a gray-bluish color, creating a
        calm and cool atmosphere. As the day transitions into morning and
        evening, the sky shifts to a deep, dark gray, fading into warmer yellow
        and orange hues near the horizon. These color changes reflect the unique
        atmospheric conditions of the planet, making its sky a fascinating
        subject for study. The accompanying images illustrate the sky's
        appearance at these two key times: at noon and near sunrise and sunset.
